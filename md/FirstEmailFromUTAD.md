I’m Eduardo and I’m one of the Portuguese team leaders. The other team leader is Tomas. 


 My teacher Pedro Mestre asked me to contact you to organize the project workflow.


To simplify our communication, I’ll write topically and objectively.


## Group Creation
In my Team (Eduardo) is mandatory to have Carlos Sampaio and Pedro Ferreira (Software Architect)

In the Tomas’s Team is mandatory to have Tiago Morais (Software Architect) and Rui Pinto.

Following these conditions, you can feel free to create your teams. 


## GitHub Repository
Since we must use github I propose, use this organization: ubicom-dsd-2023 

If you accept send me your github username to add you as admins.


## Communication
Because English is not the native language of any of us, if there are any doubts about the meaning of word or sentences, please let me know immediately. 
I know that Chinese, Portuguese and English grammar are different and the same word or expression can have different meaning in Portugal and China, 
please inform me if you find that something is wrong.
