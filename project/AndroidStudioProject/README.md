After testing, we found that HTTP communication from the Android to PC is a performance bottleneck. Therefore, we are now limiting the number of data samples sent to the server per second per sensor to a maximum of 5. Specifically, we require that data generated by the same sensor be at least 200ms apart between two HTTP transmissions. If the gap between the arrival times of two Bluetooth data is too small, the second data will be ignored.
