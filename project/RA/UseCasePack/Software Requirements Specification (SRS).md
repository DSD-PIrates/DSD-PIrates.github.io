**Brief Introduction**

When the server requests the data that the sensor starts detecting, the process starts; When the server requests to stop transmitting data, the process ends.

**Actors**

- Server

**Pre-Conditions**

- The embedded system has been powered on.

- The network is available and the server is able to send messages to the embedded system.
- The embedded system is not in **real-time data transmission mode**.

**Basic Flow**

1. The server **REQUESTs** to obtain real-time data, with the sampling rate attached.
2. The embedded system gets the **REQUEST** and send the **RESPONSE** that it is ready to deliver real-time data.
3. The embedded system enters **real-time data transmission mode**.
4. The embedded system gets real-time data and **SEND(by REQUEST)** it back to server.
5. the server get the real-time data and **RESPONSE** to the embedded system that the data is collected.
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for several times until the server no longer wants to continue receiving data.
7. The server **REQUESTs** to stop sending real-time data.
8. The embedded system stop the detection of real-time data, the embedded system exits **real-time data transmission mode**.
9. The embedded system **RESPONSE** to server that the transmission has been stopped.
10. The server receives the information.

**Exception Flows**

- 10aï¼šIf the server can not receives the **RESPONSE** from the embedded system.
  1. The server resend the **REQUEST** as in Basic Flow step 7 for at most three times, if the server gets the **RESPONSE** from the embedded system, use case ends normally. There should be a 0.5-second interval between two **REQUESTs**.
  2. After three unsuccessful attempts, the server determines that the embedded system is unreachable, use case ends with exception.

**Post Conditions**

1. Data received should be cached by the server.
2. The embedded system quits **real-time data transmission mode** after the Basic Flow.

For Exception Flow 10a, The server detected the embedded system offline.

**Supplemental Requirements**

1. Real-time data feedback function is mainly used for recording user data, and the server needs to cache the received data. After the data recording is finished, the user can choose to "upload data" or "discard data". If the user chooses to "upload data", the server will send the data to the database system. Otherwise, the server will delete the cache.
2. Sampling rate is no more than five times per second, due to hardware constraints.
3. Depending on the network environment, the latency of real-time data may vary. Generally, real-time data has a delay of around 200 milliseconds.
4. When the embedded system is in **real-time data transmission mode**, it **CAN** still process other data inquiries (such as the reachability check and sensor details) from the server. However, when the embedded system is in real-time data transmission mode, real-time data transmission requests from the server will be ignored.
5. When the embedded system is in **real-time data transmission mode**, it **CANNOT** make calibration.

### 2.3 Case 3: Server Checks Whether the Embedded System is Reachable

| ---------- | ------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Aidan, Bob | 1       | Unaudited | 2023-03-21 |

**Brief Introduction**

When the server wants to check if the embedded system is reachable, it sends an HTTP request message to the embedded system, and the process begins. When the server receives a response message from the embedded system, the process ends.

**Actors**

- Server

**Pre-Conditions**

- The embedded system has been powered on.

**Basic Flow**

1. The server sends an  **REQUEST** message to the embedded system to determine whether the embedded system is available.
2. The embedded system receives the request sent by the server.
3. The embedded system send the **RESPONSE** message to the server.
4. The server receives the response message.

**Exception Flows**

- 3a:
  1. When the embedded system send the response, a network error occurs.
  2. The embedded system do nothing, use case ends.

- 4a:
  1. When the server receives the response message, a network error occurs.
  2. The server makes another attempt to send a **REQUEST**, server will retry for at most three times. There should be a 0.5-second interval between two **REQUESTs**. If server get the **RESPONSE** from the embedded system, return to Basic Flow step 4.
  3. After server has been failed to connect for three times, server confirms that the embedded system is unreachable, use case ends.

**Post Conditions**

1. The server confirms that the embedded system is working properly and accessible.

In Exception Flow 4a, server confirms that the embedded system is inaccessible.

**Supplemental Requirements**

1. The Reachability check will be used under many conditions. For example, when a user checks whether an embedded system is connected to the network, the server needs to have a clear understanding of the accessibility of the embedded system, so the server begins a reachability check.
2. During communication, we require that **REQUEST** and **RESPONSE** must correspond one-to-one. Otherwise, it indicates that a network failure has occurred and Exception Flows are triggered. (This constraint applies to all communication issues mentioned later.)

**Brief Introduction**

When the server requests sensor calibration, the process starts; After the server receives the calibration success response or calibration failure response sent by the embedded system, the process ends.

**Actors**

- Server

**Pre-Conditions**

- The embedded system has been powered on.

- The network is available and the server is able to send messages to the embedded system.
- The embedded system is not in **real-time data transmission mode**.

**Basic Flow**

1. The server sends a sensor calibration **REQUEST**;
2. After receiving the request, the embedded system sends a response to the server and performs calibration;
3. After the embedded system calibrates the sensor successfully, it sends a **RESPONSE** to the server.
4. The server receives the information.

**Exception Flows**

- 2a: When **REQUEST** received, if the embedded system is in **real-time data transmission mode**,  the embedded system **RESPONSE** the error message to the server, use case ends.

- 2b: When **REQUEST** received, if the sensors have been calibrated in the recently ten seconds, the embedded system will refuse to calibrate and **RESPONSE** the error message to the server, use case ends.
- 4a: If server failed to receive the information, the server will check the reachability of the embedded system, and Requests Sensor Calibration again if the embedded system is accessible.

**Post Conditions**

1. The server will receive the information of calibration from the embedded system after the Basic Flow.

**Supplemental Requirements**

During calibration, it should be ensured that the sensor is placed on a horizontal stand. The calibration here refers to the acceleration calibration. Since the acceleration of the sensor is measured by the acceleration due to gravity, calibration should be performed before use.
